   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon sunflower oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
    <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1/2 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 tea spoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4  teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4  teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1/2  teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
    <li>1 cup diced carrots</li>
    <li>1/2 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped into 1 to 2 inch pieces</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>4 ripe plantains, peeled and cut diagonally into 1/2-inch slices</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of sunflower oil for frying</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes. Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Heat 3 tablespoons sunflower oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes.
    <li>Stir reserved chicken broth, water, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice. Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with friend plantains and serve with chicken.</li>
    </li>
