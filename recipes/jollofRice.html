    <li>Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. <br>Add ½ onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. <br>Mix well.<br> Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes. <br>Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 minutes and remove from heat.</li>
   <p>  <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. <br>Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve.<br> Reserve 1 ½cups liquid. <br>Discard solids.</li></p>
   <p>  <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li></p>
   <p>  <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.<br> An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li></p>
   <p> <li>Heat 3 tablespoons sunflower oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook ½ onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes.<br> Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>
    <p> <li>Stir reserved chicken broth, water, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper into the pot.<br> Bring to a simmer; add rice. Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes.<br> Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes.</li></p>
    <p>  <li>Heat ½ cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. <br>Add plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.<br> Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with friend plantains and serve with chicken.</li></p>
